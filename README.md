# AUTOMATIC-HAND-SANITIZER-DISPENSER-SYSTEM
An automatic hand sanitizer dispensing machine is an automated,  non  contact,  alcohol  based  hand  sanitizer dispenser, which finds its use in hospitals, work places, offices, schools and much more. Alcohol is basically a solvent, and also a very good disinfectant when compared to liquid soap or solid soap, also it does not need water to wash off since it is volatile and evaporates  instantly after application  to hands.  It is also proven  that  a  concentration  of  >70%  alcohol  can  kill Coronavirus in  hands. Here, an  ultrasonic sensor senses  the hand  placed  near  it,  the  Arduino  uno  is  used  as  a microcontroller, which senses the distance and the result is the pump running to pump out the hand sanitizer. To avoid any contact at all, some no-touch hand sanitizer dispensers are commercially available, but they are expensive and most off-the-shelf commercial sanitizers cannot be automated. In this project, we create a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser that can be used for any press-to-release hand sanitizer available in the market.
